:description: about Helidon MP
:keywords: helidon, java, microservices, microprofile
:h1Prefix:MP

Helidon MP is an Eclipse MicroProfile runtime that allows the Jakarta EE community to run microservices in a portable way.


== About Helidon MP Components

Helidon MP {helidon-version} is an implementation of the
https://microprofile.io[MicroProfile]
https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile/releases[specification] and supports MicroProfile {mp-version}. Since
MicroProfile has its roots in Java EE, the MicroProfile
APIs follow a familiar, declarative approach with heavy use of annotations.
This makes it a good choice for Java EE developers.

|=======
|CDI Extensions
|In addition to MicroProfile support, Helidon MP provides CDI extensions to address areas not covered by MicroProfile.<<mp/extensions/01_overview.adoc,Learn more>>.

|MP Configuration
|The Config component provides a Java API to load and process configuration properties in key/value form into a Config object which the application can use to retrieve config data.
<<mp/config/introduction.adoc, Learn more>>. 

|  CORS Support
|  Although it is possible for any Helidon application to implement its own support for CORS, there are common tasks (such as processing preflight requests) that can be provided in a Helidon module. <<mp/cors/01_introduction.adoc, Learn more>>. 

| gRPC 
|  Helidon gRPC Server provides a framework for creating gRPC (general-purpose Remote Procedure Calls) applications.
<<mp/grpc/01_introduction.adoc, Learn more>>.

| Health Checks 
|  The health check API combines the statuses of all the dependencies that affect availability and the ability to perform correctly such as network latency and storage. <<mp/health/01_health.adoc, Learn more>>.


|JAX-RS/Jersey
|Helidon MP supports building RESTful services using JAX-RS/Jersey. <<mp/jaxrs/02_server-configuration.adoc, Learn more>>.


|JSON-P and JSON-B  
|  Helidon supports both JSON processing (JSON P) and JSON building (JSON B) APIs.


|Metrics 
|Heldion supports both a base set and a Helidon-specific set of metrics that expose information in JSON format (as specified by the MicroProfile Metrics specification) or in plain text (for Prometheus metrics). 
<<mp/metrics/01_metrics.adoc, Learn more>>.


|OpenAPI  
|The OpenAPI in Helidon SE allows your Helidon SE application to serve an OpenAPI document that describes your applicationâ€™s endpoints.
<<mp/openapi/01_openapi.adoc, Learn more>>.

|OpenTracing 
|Helidon includes support for tracing through the OpenTracing APIs. Tracing is integrated with WebServer, gRPC Server, and Security.
<<mp/tracing/07_tracing.adoc, Learn more>>.


|Reactive Messaging and Reactive Operators
|With Helidon MP 2.0 you can now formalize manipulation with reactive streams and reactive messaging. Reactive messaging heavily depends on standardized operators so together they provide great portability between existing implementations. <<mp/reactivemessaging/01_introduction.adoc, Learn more about Reactive Messaging>> and <<mp/reactivestreams/01_introduction.adoc, Reactive Streams>>.

|Security 
|The security modules modules support authentication, authorization, outbound security and audits for your applications.
<<mp/security/01_introduction.adoc, Learn more>>.

=== MicroProfile APIs


MicroProfile starts with a core set of Java EE APIs, such as Config, Metrics and Fault Tolerance. Helidon then defines a number
of new APIs to add capabilities you need for writing modern cloud native
applications. 


For more information see <<mp/guides/01_overview.adoc,guides>>.

For more information about the Helidon MicroProfile APIs see  https://github.com/oracle/helidon/wiki/Supported-APIs[the Helidon API Wiki page].



=== No Application Server

Helidon is a collection of libraries that runs on top of Netty. It is not
derived from a Java EE application server. That means your cloud native
application is compact and efficient without unnecessary overhead or bloat.

=== GraalVM Native Image Support for Helidon MP
GraalVM native-image support is now available for both Helidon MP and Helidon SE. Helidon MP includes support for GraalVM to enable the conversion of Helidon MP applications to native executable code via the native-image utility.

=== MicroProfile Reactive Messaging and Reactive Streams Operators
Asynchronous messaging is a commonly used form of communication in the world of microservices and the Reactive Messaging for MicroProfile specification is a logical response to formalizing the ways we connect things together. And the best way to communicate asychronously is through Reactive Streams. With the release of the MicroProfile Reactive Streams Operators specification we can now formalize manipulation with reactive streams. Reactive messaging heavily depends on standardized operators so together they provide great portability between existing implementations.
