= About Helidon MP
:description: about Helidon MP
:keywords: helidon, java, microservices, microprofile

Helidon is a collection of Java libraries for writing microservices and offers two programming models: Helidon MP and <<se/introduction/01_introduction.adoc,Helidon SE>>.


== Helidon MP

Helidon MP {helidon-version} is an implementation of the
https://microprofile.io[MicroProfile]
https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile/releases[specification] and supports MicroProfile {mp-version}. Since
MicroProfile has its roots in Java EE, the MicroProfile
APIs follow a familiar, declarative approach with heavy use of annotations.
This makes it a good choice for Java EE developers. 

For comparison, the high-level differences between Helidon MP and Helidon SE are described below. 


=== MicroProfile APIs


MicroProfile starts with a core of Java EE APIs, then defines a number
of new APIs to add capabilities you need for writing modern cloud native
applications.

* JAX-RS
* JSON-P
* JSON-B
* CDI
* MicroProfile Config
* MicroProfile Fault Tolerance
* MicroProfile Health Checks
* MicroProfile JWT Authentication
* MicroProfile Metrics
* MicroProfile OpenAPI
* MicroProfile OpenTracing
* MicroProfile Rest Client

For more information about the Helidon MicroProfile APIs see  https://github.com/oracle/helidon/wiki/Supported-APIs[the Helidon API Wiki page].

=== Helidon MP CDI Extensions

In addition to MicroProfile support, Helidon MP provides
<<mp/extensions/01_overview.adoc,CDI extensions>> to address areas not
covered by MicroProfile. Examples include:

* DataSource for Oracle UCP and HikariCP
* JPA
* JTA
* Jedis
* OCI Object storage


=== No Application Server

Helidon is a collection of libraries that runs on top of Netty. It is not
derived from a Java EE application server. That means your cloud native
application is compact and efficient without unnecessary overhead or bloat.

=== GraalVM Native Image Support for Helidon MP
Helidon now includes support for GraalVM to enable the conversion of Helidon MP applications to native executable code via the native-image utility.
GraalVM native-image support is now available for both Helidon MP and Helidon SE.

=== MicroProfile Reactive Messaging and Reactive Streams Operators
Asynchronous messaging is a commonly used form of communication in the world of microservices and the Reactive Messaging for MicroProfile specification is a logical response to formalizing the ways we connect things together. And the best way to communicate asychronously is through Reactive Streams. With the release of the MicroProfile Reactive Streams Operators specification we can now formalize manipulation with reactive streams. Reactive messaging heavily depends on standardized operators so together they provide great portability between existing implementations.
